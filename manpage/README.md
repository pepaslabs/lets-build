## Let's read a man page

To read the [man page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) of the `fread` function, run the `man` command [in a terminal](../terminal/README.md):

```
$ man fread
```

`man` uses the `less` program to display the manual.

You can quit out of `less` by pressing 'q'.  You can scroll up and down using the arrow keys.
